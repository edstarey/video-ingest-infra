# Video Ingest Infrastructure - Technical Specifications

## System Architecture

### Overview
The Video Ingest Infrastructure is designed as a cloud-native, microservices-based system on AWS, optimized for scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

### Core Components

#### 1. Networking Layer (VPC Module)

- **Subnet Strategy**:
  - Public subnets: ALB, NAT Gateways
  - Private subnets: ECS tasks, RDS instances
  - Database subnets: Isolated RDS subnet group
- **CIDR Allocation**: /16 VPC with /24 subnets
- **Security Groups**: Principle of least privilege

#### 2. Storage Layer (S3 Module)
- **Primary Bucket**: Video file storage with versioning
- **Lifecycle Policies**:
  - Standard → IA after 30 days
  - IA → Glacier after 90 days
  - Glacier → Deep Archive after 365 days
- **Security**: Server-side encryption (SSE-S3), bucket policies
- **Access**: CloudFront OAI for secure content delivery

#### 3. Database Layer (RDS Module)
- **Engine**: PostgreSQL 15.x
- **Configuration**: Multi-AZ for production, single-AZ for dev
- **Storage**: GP3 with auto-scaling enabled
- **Backup**: 7-day retention, automated snapshots
- **Security**: Encryption at rest, VPC security groups

#### 4. Compute Layer (ECS Module)
- **Platform**: AWS Fargate for serverless containers
- **Scaling**: Target tracking based on CPU/memory utilization
- **Service Discovery**: AWS Cloud Map integration
- **Health Checks**: Application-level health endpoints
- **Deployment**: Rolling updates with circuit breaker

#### 5. Load Balancing (ALB Module)
- **Type**: Application Load Balancer
- **SSL Termination**: ACM certificates
- **Health Checks**: Custom health check paths
- **Sticky Sessions**: Cookie-based for stateful operations
- **WAF Integration**: Basic protection rules

#### 6. API Management (API Gateway Module)
- **Type**: REST API Gateway
- **Authentication**: IAM roles and API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-client throttling
- **Caching**: Response caching for GET operations
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration

#### 7. Content Delivery (CloudFront Module)
- **Distribution**: Global edge locations
- **Origins**: S3 bucket and ALB
- **Caching**: Optimized for video content
- **Security**: SSL/TLS, signed URLs for private content
- **Compression**: Gzip for text-based responses

#### 8. Security (Security Module)
- **IAM**: Role-based access with least privilege
- **Secrets**: AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
- **Encryption**: KMS keys for data encryption
- **Network**: Security groups, NACLs
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, GDPR considerations

#### 9. Monitoring (Monitoring Module)
- **Logs**: Centralized CloudWatch logging
- **Metrics**: Custom application metrics
- **Alarms**: Proactive alerting
- **Dashboards**: Operational visibility
- **Tracing**: X-Ray for distributed tracing

## Technical Decisions

### Compute: ECS Fargate vs Lambda
**Decision**: ECS Fargate
**Rationale**:
- Video processing requires sustained compute resources
- Better cost predictability for long-running services
- Superior integration with ALB for HTTP services
- No cold start latency issues
- Better suited for containerized microservices

### Database: RDS vs DynamoDB
**Decision**: RDS PostgreSQL
**Rationale**:
- Complex relational queries for video metadata
- ACID compliance for user data
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Better fit for structured data relationships

### CDN: CloudFront vs Third-party
**Decision**: AWS CloudFront
**Rationale**:
- Native AWS integration
- Cost-effective for AWS-hosted content
- Built-in security features
- Global edge network

## Environment Specifications

### Development Environment
```hcl
# Instance sizes optimized for cost
rds_instance_class = "db.t3.micro"
ecs_cpu = 256
ecs_memory = 512
enable_multi_az = false
backup_retention_period = 1
```

### Staging Environment
```hcl
# Production-like configuration
rds_instance_class = "db.t3.small"
ecs_cpu = 512
ecs_memory = 1024
enable_multi_az = true
backup_retention_period = 7
```

### Production Environment
```hcl
# High availability and performance
rds_instance_class = "db.r6g.large"
ecs_cpu = 1024
ecs_memory = 2048
enable_multi_az = true
backup_retention_period = 30
enable_deletion_protection = true
```

## Security Specifications

### Network Security
- VPC Flow Logs enabled
- Security groups with minimal required ports
- NACLs for additional layer of protection
- Private subnets for all application components

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest for all storage services
- Encryption in transit with TLS 1.2+
- KMS key rotation enabled
- Secrets rotation via Secrets Manager

### Access Control
- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- Service-linked roles for AWS services
- Cross-account access via assume roles
- MFA enforcement for administrative access

## Performance Specifications

### Scalability Targets
- **ECS Services**: Auto-scale 1-10 tasks based on CPU/memory
- **RDS**: Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- **S3**: Unlimited storage with request rate optimization
- **CloudFront**: Global distribution with edge caching

### Performance Metrics
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for metadata operations
- **Video Upload**: Support for files up to 5GB
- **CDN Cache Hit Ratio**: > 85% for video content
- **Database Connections**: Connection pooling enabled

## Cost Optimization
